本章介绍实时渲染的核心内容，所谓 渲染流水线 ，或所谓“ 管线 ”。渲染流水线的主要功能是，从给定的虚拟相机，三维物件，光源等，生成或者说“ 渲染 ”出一张二维的图片。 流水线就是实时渲染的底层机制了。此流程可见图2.1（本书不插图，请见原书，下同）。 渲染结果图中的物体位置由以下因素决定：所有物件的几何形状，环境特征，相机的位置。 结果图中物体的外观特征由以下因素决定：材质，光源，贴图，以及着色器程。 图2.1注： 左侧可见虚拟相机在金字塔的尖端处（4条线汇集处）。只有可见范围内的物件会被渲染。在透视相机（这个图里就是这种）的渲染中，可见范围是一个 平头锥体 。 右图是相机所“见”的效果。注意左边的红色甜甜圈没被渲染出来，因为它在可见范围外。以及蓝色的那个玩意儿，被裁剪了一部分。 之后的内容我们逐个阶段进行介绍，但是着重于功能而不是实现，实现后面的章节会讲","breadcrumbs":"渲染流水线 » 渲染流水线","id":"2","title":"渲染流水线"},"3":{"body":"现实世界中流水线有多个含义，我们渲染里也取这个词来用，表示流水线分成多个阶段，每个阶段代表一个比较独立的大任务。 流水线的每级是并行的，其输入依赖前一级的输出。理想情况下，n级的流水线效率提升应当是没有流水化的n倍。这是我们采用流水线的主要原因。例略。 流水线会因为最慢的一级没有完成任务而停机。我们把这一级叫做流水线的 瓶颈 ，后面的级就处于 饥饿 状态。 实时渲染流水线可以粗略分成4个阶段：应用程序，几何处理，光栅化，像素处理。见图2.2。这个图很重要，它是后面的章节的重要的基础。通常每个阶段自己都是一条流水线，也就是说每个阶段包含了若干的子阶段。 我们此处需要区分功能上的阶段和实现上的阶段。功能上每个阶段有特定的事情要做，但是不指明具体怎么实现的。实际的实现其实可能会把多个阶段结合到一个计算单元里面去，也可能把一个费时间的计算过程拆分到不同的硬件单元去。 图2.2 前略。每个阶段可以自己又是一个流水线，例如几何处理阶段；也可以是一个并行处理的阶段，例如像素处理阶段。图中的应用程序阶段是表示成了一个单独的阶段，但这个阶段也可以被流水化或者并行化。 注意光栅化阶段找到了一个图元或者说三角形里内部的的这些像素。 渲染的速度使用 每秒的帧数 （fps）来表征，也就是每秒能渲染出多少张图片。也可以用 赫兹 （Hz）作为单位。使用渲染一张图片需要多少毫秒来表征速度的方法也很常见。 渲染一帧所需的时间根据实际情况会有很大差别。fps可以表征特定帧的生成速度，也可以表征平均的性能。赫兹用于硬件，是设置为定值的。 如其名，应用阶段是被应用驱动的，通常情况是在cpu上实现。cpu通常是多核的，具有并行处理的能力。因此适合处理应用阶段的各种各样的任务。常见的这样的任务有：碰撞检测，一些全局的加速优化（原文global acceleration algorithms），动画，物理模拟，等等。 下一个主要阶段是几何处理，负责坐标变换，投影，所有的几何上的处理。此阶段决定什么东西要被画，怎么画，画在哪。此阶段在gpu上执行，包含很多可编程的计算核和一些做死的计算硬件。 光栅化阶段把输入的3个顶点，组成三角形，然后找到内部的像素，然后把他们喂给下一个阶段。 最后像素阶段对每个像素执行一个程序，决定其颜色，或再根据深度测试决定是否像素可见。此阶段也可以执行其他逐像素操作，如根据前一个像素的颜色和新计算的像素的颜色混合出最终的颜色。 光栅化阶段和像素阶段都完全在gpu上执行。 接下来4个部分讨论所有这些阶段。更多细节见 图形处理单元","breadcrumbs":"渲染流水线 » 架构 » 2.1 架构","id":"3","title":"2.1 架构"},"4":{"body":"因为大多是cpu计算，所以开发者决定这个阶段该干嘛，怎么实现，怎么优化。但是有时候这个阶段还是能影响后面的阶段的。例如，某应用程序阶段的算法决定哪些三角形需要拿来渲染。 但是有的应用阶段也可以用gpu来运算。因为gpu有 compute shader ，用它可以把gpu当作通用并行计算核来使用，无视其图形渲染的功能。 此阶段最后，需要把需要绘制的几何传给下一阶段。这些东西被我们称作 渲染图元 。包括点，线，三角形，或者说所有可能被画到屏幕上的玩意儿。这个工作是应用程序阶段的最重要的任务。 因为这个阶段通常是cpu计算，它就不像其他阶段一样可以拆分为子阶段。不过为了提高性能，此阶段通常在多个核上并行处理。cpu中还有超标量结构，可以支持同时执行多个操作。 18.5 会介绍一些多核计算的实现方法。 此阶段常见的一个工作是 碰撞检测 。可在检测到两个物体有碰撞后，产生响应并返回给碰撞物体，或者传递给力反馈设备（译注：手柄？）。 此阶段还负责处理外部设备的输入，如键盘，鼠标，头戴式显示设备等；根据输入可以进行若干处理。一些加速算法也在这个阶段发生，例如典型的剔除算法。此阶段还有包括后面的渲染流程无法做的其他所有事情。","breadcrumbs":"渲染流水线 » 应用程序阶段 » 2.2 应用程序阶段","id":"4","title":"2.2 应用程序阶段"},"5":{"body":"运行在gpu中的几何阶段负责大部分的逐三角形或逐顶点的计算。此阶段从功能上可分为：顶点着色，投影，裁剪，屏幕映射。见图2.3。 图2.3 几何阶段被分为这4个阶段","breadcrumbs":"渲染流水线 » 几何阶段 » 2.3 几何阶段","id":"5","title":"2.3 几何阶段"},"6":{"body":"此阶段有两个目标：1是计算所有顶点的位置，2是计算任何程序员想计算的顶点上的数据，例如法向量或者贴图坐标。 传统地做法是，物体的着色是由它的每个顶点的位置、法向量，再根据光照计算得来，并且顶点上就存算得的颜色数据，后续步骤把顶点上的颜色插值到每个像素。 因此，可编程的顶点着色计算单元又称为顶点着色器。在现在的gpu里，所有的着色都是逐像素的，顶点着色阶段不用负责着色方程的计算了，而是变得非常通用。 现在这个阶段只是处理关联在逐顶点的数据。比如使用 4.4 的方法，可以使用此阶段给一个物体实现动画的效果。 首先介绍位置如何计算，物体从一开始到最后到屏幕上画处理，中间涉及好几个空间，或者说好几个坐标系。 一开始模型在自己的 模型空间 里。 不同模型之间通过 模型变换 关联起来。一个模型可以关联多个这样的变换。这用来实现一个模型对应多个实例的功能。实例可以放在不同的位置上，拥有不同的大小，旋转，而避免复制模型自身数据。 模型变换要变的是模型的顶点和法向量。物体一开始叫做处于模型坐标系，把变换应用上之后，物体就处于世界坐标系，或者说世界空间。世界空间只有一个，模型们都变换完后，就同处于这一个世界空间内。 如前文所述，只有相机看到的东西需要被渲染。相机在世界空间中有位置和朝向。为了解决投影和裁剪，对相机和所有模型要进行 观察变换 。这个变换的目的是把相机放到原点，让它对着负z轴方向拍摄，然后正y方向是上面，正x是右手边。这里使用负z方向，也有使用正z方向的，两种没什么大差别，相互变换也很容易。这里使用哪种位置和方向的定义取决于实际的图形api。这个空间被称作 相机空间 ，或者 观察空间 ， eye space（译注：不译） 。图2.4展示了一个定义的例子。模型变换和观察变换的实现都是使用4x4的矩阵，在 c4 会介绍。我们一定要理解的是，顶点的位置和法向量是程序员想算成多少就能算成多少的。 图2.4 懒译，反正展示了最后的相机空间是怎么摆的。 接下来我们要介绍顶点着色的另一个输出。为了渲染出真实场景效果，只渲染物体的位置和形状是不够的，还要考虑他们的外观特性。具体需要考虑每个物体的材质，以及所有光源是如何影响到这个物体的。材质和光照可以用好多方法来建模，简单的可以只是颜色，复杂的可以是某种物理特性的表述。 决定材质和光照产生的效果的步骤叫做 着色 。着色需要在物体的各个点上计算一个 着色方程 。一般来说，这个计算的一部分在几何阶段进行，也有一些在逐像素的阶段进行。很多材质信息可以逐顶点存储，例如位置，法向量，颜色，及其他着色计算需要的数值。顶点着色的结果（包含颜色，向量，材质坐标等数据）传送到像素阶段，插值到像素，然后计算最终表面的着色。 本书 c3 和 c5 会深入介绍以gpu顶点着色器来表示的顶点着色。 顶点着色中会进行 投影 和 裁剪 ，这两步把观察内的体积（译注：以前说的平截头体）变换成一个单位立方体，坐标从(-1,-1,-1)到(1,1,1)。这个范围也是随意定义的，比如z可以定义成从0到1。这个立方体叫做 规范化的观察体积 （译注：从空间的角度，《引架》里叫齐次裁剪空间）。两个步骤里先进行投影，在gpu里通过顶点着色器进行。一般有两种投影方式， 正交投影 和 透视投影 。如图2.5。正交投影又常被称作平行投影，但是它只是平行投影中的一种。建筑领域还常用其他的一些种，具体懒译。 注意投影也是用矩阵表示的（ 4.7 ），因此它可以跟其他的几何变换先结合运算。 正交投影的观察体积是个长方体，正交投影变换把它变换成单位立方体。正交投影的特征是平行线变换后还是平行线。这个变换就是个位移和缩放的组合。 透视投影稍复杂。投影后有近大远小的效果。平行线在视平线处出现灭点。这模仿了人眼感知事物的方式。透视投影的观察体积是平截头体，它也是被变换到单位立方体。两种透视变换都可以用4x4矩阵表示（见 c4 ）。变换完后模型就在 裁剪坐标系 里。它是个齐次坐标系，也是 c4 会介绍。这一步发生在除以w之前，为了后续功能步骤和裁剪能正常工作，顶点着色器的输出必须是这个类型的（译注：vec4）。 虽然这些变换是把体积变成另一个体积，但是因为后面z轴信息不是存储在图片里，而是在一个叫z-buffer的地方，所以模型还是从3维投影成了2维。z-buffer在 2.5 中介绍。","breadcrumbs":"渲染流水线 » 几何阶段 » 2.3.1 顶点着色","id":"6","title":"2.3.1 顶点着色"},"7":{"body":"每个流水线都得有上述的顶点处理功能。上述步骤完成后，gpu上还有一些其他功能可选。细分曲面，几何着色，流输出。是否使用他们取决于硬件是否支持，以及程序员是否想用。通常这些功能是不用的。详见 c3 。 第一个可选阶段是细分曲面。假设你要画一个球，你会用一些三角形面来表示它。但是马上就会陷入性能和效果的两难之中。如果面数太少，球在近处看就很糙，如果面数很多，性能就受不了。使用细分曲面功能可以对区面生成合适数量的面。 之前我们提到了三角形，以及目前为止我们只谈了用流水线处理三角形。实际上它还能处理点，线，三角形，和其他东西。顶点数据可以用来描述一个曲面。 这样的平面可以由一组patch（译注：不会翻）定义，每个patch由一组顶点来定义。 细分曲面这一步骤本身可分为若干个步骤：hull着色器（译注，不会翻），细分曲面器，domain着色器。他们把patch顶点数据转换成（一般来说更多）顶点数据，然后用来生成三角形。相机的距离影响生成三角形的数量：近的时候多，远的时候少。 下一个可选阶段是几何着色器。它比细分曲面出现得更早，所以在gpu中也更常见支持。它像细分曲面一样，也是输入某种图元，然后生成新的顶点数据。它更简单一些，对顶点的创建的范围有限（？），可以生成的图元类型也有限得多。它的若干中用途中，最常见的一个是粒子生成。假设要模拟烟花爆炸，每个火球用一个顶点代表。几何着色器可以把每个点转化成一个面向屏幕的方形（两个三角形）。这就提供了一种更靠谱的图元给程序员来给它着色。 最后一个可选阶段叫做流输出。这可以让我们把gpu当作顶点生成器。我们可以关掉后面的绘制步骤，把处理过的顶点当作数组传输出来，供其他使用。数据可以被cpu使用，也可以再被gpu使用。这个步骤的典型用法也是粒子模拟，如之前说的烟花模拟。 这3个步骤的执行顺序是这样的：细分曲面，几何着色，流输出。每个阶段都是可选的。不论如何，现在我们有了在齐次空间内的一堆顶点数据了。接下来我们可以检查他们能不能被相机看到。","breadcrumbs":"渲染流水线 » 几何阶段 » 2.3.2","id":"7","title":"2.3.2"},"8":{"body":"只有全部或部分在观察体积内的图元会传给光栅化阶段，然后画到屏幕上。完全在外面的图元就被丢弃了。需要被裁剪的是部分在里面的图元。例如一根线有个顶点在外面，就应该裁剪一下，外面的点被丢弃，线段与体积边界的交点会成为这个线段的新顶点。之前的投影步骤等使得裁剪永远在单位立方体上面执行，使裁剪问题变成一个固定的问题。 裁剪可见图2.6的示意。此外，除了使用这6个面来裁剪之外，用户也可以自定义平面来显式地分割物体，这种操作叫做切片，见图19.1，第818页。 裁剪使用投影阶段产生的4维的齐次坐标系。在透视空间里裁剪的位置计算不能用简单的线性插值，第4个维度就是为了解决这个问题而存在的。最后会执行 透视除法 ，把结果的三角形位置转换到3维 归一化的设备坐标系 。之前提到过，观察体积的范围是(-1, -1, -1)到(1, 1, 1)。最后一步会把这个范围转换到窗口坐标里。","breadcrumbs":"渲染流水线 » 几何阶段 » 2.3.3 裁剪","id":"8","title":"2.3.3 裁剪"},"9":{"body":"只有观察体积内的图元进入此阶段，此时坐标还是3维的。x和y坐标被转换成 屏幕坐标 。带z坐标的屏幕坐标也被称作 窗口坐标 。假设场景会被渲染到屏幕上从(x1, y1)到(x2, y2)的范围内。那么屏幕映射就是平移加缩放操作的组合。新的x和y就是屏幕坐标，z也被映射到某个范围[z1, z2]。默认z1是0，z2是1。不同api可能不同。之后窗口坐标传入光栅化阶段。 屏幕映射见图2.7示意。 接下来介绍和像素有关的整型和浮点数值运算。给一行笛卡尔坐标系内的像素，最左像素的左边的x坐标在浮点数表示下是0.0。opengl一直用这种表示，dx10也沿用了。像素的中心点是0.5位置。所以从0到9这10个像素的覆盖范围是[0.0, 10.0)。转换方式如下： \\[ d = floor(c) \\] \\[ c = d + 0.5 \\] d是像素的编号（整形），c是像素内连续的位置（浮点）。 所有api的水平坐标都是从左往右增长的，但是上下方向不同api有不同。opengl使用笛卡尔坐标，左下角的坐标是最小的。dx优势把左上定义为坐标最小的。比如(0, 0)在opengl里是图片的左下角，在dx里是左上角。程序更换api的时候这个区分要特殊注意。","breadcrumbs":"渲染流水线 » 几何阶段 » 2.3.4 屏幕映射","id":"9","title":"2.3.4
